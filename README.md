# Instructions
The only file whose permissions need to be reset is `m-set`. After writing 
a new bash-script, run `m-set <file-name>`. This will make the new file 
executable.

## To-Do
1. Write script that sets up a personal environment on linux, darwin, and 
windows machines (installs tex, vim, and the scripts in this directory).
2. Figure out issue with `cd`...
3. Write script that checks if git repos have been pushed to main. If there 
are commits but no push, it creates a new branch and pushes there.
